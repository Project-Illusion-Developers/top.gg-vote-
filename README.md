# top.gg-discord.py-upvote
A up-vote system for top.gg suitable for discord.py.

I couldn't find source code for a top.gg upvote system so I decided to post mine to help new developers out

This file will return a true false statement if a user has upvoted, you need to understand how to use cogs and have this file in the same location as your
start file for your bot.
